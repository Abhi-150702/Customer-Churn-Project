# Customer-Churn-Project
Crafted a sophisticated Machine Learning Model utilizing a Bank dataset to accurately predict customer churn rates. Employed various classification algorithms and evaluated model performance using robust metrics to ensure optimal results.

# DataSet
Dataset had 14 features amongst which 11 were selected for the further process. There were 7 categorical features and 5 numerical features. Exploratory Data Analysis vas performed first using univariate analysis followed by bivariate analysis. Performed One Hot Encoding on categorical features and scaled numerical features.
